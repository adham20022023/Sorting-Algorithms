## Description

### Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly inserting elements in the correct position in a sorted sublist. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) and is useful for small datasets or partially sorted datasets.

### Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays, sorting them and then merging the sorted subarrays to produce the final sorted output. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is useful for large datasets.

### Heap Sort

Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by building a binary heap from the input array and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap and inserting it into the sorted part of the array. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and is useful for large datasets.

### Quick Sort

Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by partitioning the input array into smaller subarrays based on a pivot element, recursively sorting the subarrays and then combining them to produce the final sorted output. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) on average and O(n^2) in the worst case. It is widely used in practice due to its efficiency and simplicity.
